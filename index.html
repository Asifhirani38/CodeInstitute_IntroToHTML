<!-- 
!DOCTYPE has to be the first thing in the HTML document. 
It is NOT an HTML tag. It tells the browser about the version of HTML this document uses. 
Always add the DOCTYPE declaration!

					Morden web development is derived from News Paper/print media. HTML is the standard markup language for creating
					Web pages. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML describes the structure of a webpage. HTML is
					regulated by W3C which stands for World Wide Web Consortium. <a href="https://www.w3.org/"> Visit World Wide Web
					  Consortium </a>
				  </p>
				</li>

				<li>
				  <p> Easiest way to create HTML page on the computer is by creating text file using notepad program and then
					changing
					the file extension from .txt to html. Notepad++ is also the good editor for writing HTML file. </p>
				</li>

				<li>
				  <p>Images can be added to HTML using <img> tab and specifying source of the image (local file or online webpage
					link). Image can be resized
					using height and width attributes. We can use either pixel size of percentage method to resize the image in
					html.
					The word 'pixel' comes from the word 'picture element' in the olden days.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
				  <p> We can add styles to HTML page by using style tag. style is added to head tag. {} brackets are used to specify
					various properties like
					color,font,alignment,font size etc. of the text. </p>
				</li>

				<li>
				  <p> Main tag is used inside the HTML page to indicate that its main content</p>
				</li>

				<li>
				  <p> hr tag is used to draw horizontal line below the text. It is used to separate the content of the page. </p>

					Design Thinking encourages teams to put the user first while fostering creativity in exploring possible solutions. 
					This winning combination makes it one of the most valuable problem-solving methods available today.t involves understanding people’s needs, empathizing with their experience, reframing the challenge to generate out-of-the-box solutions, prototyping and continuously refining ideas, and testing these prototypes with real users to create successful products.generate out-of-the-box solutions. <a href="https://makeiterate.com/the-stanford-design-thinking-process/"> The Design Thinking Process: </a>

		<h3> <u> Introduction of Programming Paradigms: </u> </h3>
			
			<ol>
				<li>
				  <p> Programming paradigm is an approach to solve problem using some programming language or also we can say it is a method to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach. There are lots for programming language that are known but all of them need to follow some strategy when they are implemented and this methodology/strategy is paradigms.  </p>
				
					<image src="C:\Users\520002\Downloads\PracticeCode\ProgrammingParadigms.png"> <br> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-programming-paradigms/"> Introduction to Programming Paradigms </a> </br>
				</li>
				
				<li> 
					
					<p> Imperative programming is a software development paradigm where Functions are implicitly coded in every step required to solve a problem. In imperative programming, every operation is coded and the code itself specifies how the problem is to be solved, which means that pre-coded models are not called on.</p> 
				
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p> Declarative programming describes what you want the program to achieve rather than how it should run.

						In other words, within the declarative paradigm, you define the results you want a program to accomplish without describin its control flow. Ultimately, it’s up to the programming language’s implementation and the compiler to determine how to achieve the results. This places emphasis not on the execution process, but on the results and their ties to your overall goal. </p>

				<li>
				
				  <p> Declarative programming languages often work hand-in-hand with Imperative programming languages.
					In Full-Stack programming, we take advantage of what both paradigms have to offer.
					Throughout the programme, you will immerse yourself in both paradigms and utilize the strengths of each.
					You will begin with the HTML and CSS declarative languages
					then explore the JavaScript and Python Imperative languages before returning to the SQL Declarative language.
					As you progress, you will combine all of these languages and their supporting tools by taking advantage of their
					individual strengths in producing compelling web-based experiences. </p>

		<h3> <u> Introduction HTML Programming Language: </u> </h3>

			<ol>		
				<li>
					  <p> 
					  
						The first thing in every HTML document should be the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration because it tells the browser the version of HTML to expect in the current document. In this case, HTML version 5 (abbreviated to HTML5) is used. It is not an HTML tag, but it is placed above the opening HTML tag as the first thing included in the HTML file. A page can have only one DOCTYPE declaration. When you view the page in a browser, the declaration is not visible. 
					  
					  </p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p>The <u> html</u> element tells the browser that the current document is a HTML document. This element contains the entire web page. It’s a container for all the other elements and is defined by its opening 'html' and closing '/html' tags. The html element is also known as the root element. This element has two directly contained (child) elements namely; <u> head </u> and <u> body </u>. </p>
				
				</li>
				
				<li> 
					<p> 
					
						When writing HTML code, it is always a good idea to create your closing tag immediately after creating your opening tag. That way, you won’t forget to do it later. Many code editors will add it automatically for you. 
					</p>
					
				</li>

				<li>
					<p> The famous hyperlink element, <em> <u> also known as the anchor </u> </em>, has an attribute that
						contains the address of the HTML resource that it links to. In HTML content links that are supposed to be interacted with you is the anchor element.
						The anchor element defines an anchor or a specific part of a page that
						can be linked to and a link article somewhere so it needs an address.So to use the anchor element as a link to another page we use the href attribute.
						Which will hold the address of where it needs to go to, the href attribute
						has as its value the location of the page or resource we'd like to link to.
					</p>
					
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p> 
					
						The <u> head </u> element contains metadata about the page and links to external resources such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript files. This element is the first child of <u> html </u> element. It holds all the information about the page that is not displayed in the browser.

						Metadata – is data that describes other data. For example, it can specify who wrote the document and provide a list of keywords and phrases used in the document. We will discuss metadata in more detail in a later section of this module.
					
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li> 
					<p> 
						
						The <u> title </u> element is contained (nested) inside the <u> head </u> element. It displays the document title. This title will appear in the browser tab rather than on the main browser window. Nothing listed within the <u> head </u> element directly appears on the main browser screen.
					
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					  <p> 
							The <u>body</u> element uses any local or external CSS and JavaScript included in the <head> element to apply logic and styling to itself and its contents.

						  Any visible web page content is created within the opening and closing <u>body</u> tags.

						  The <u>body</u> element is the only sibling of the <u> head </u> so it is also a first descendant of the <u> html </u> element. It's created immediately below the <u> head </u> element.

						  The <u>body</u> element contains the visible parts of the web document (page). Everything that a user sees on the page lives inside the <u>body</u>. Therefore, all of the page's content will be added within the <u>body</u> tags.

						  Content can include images, paragraphs, headings, links, forms, tables, lists. We'll get to play with all of these as we go through the course. 
						  
						</p>
				</li>

			</ol>
		
		<h3>Div and Span elements in HTML </h3>
			<ol> 
				<li> 
					<p> 
					
					The <u> div </u> element is used as a container for other HTML elements. The <u> div </u> element is often used to group sections of a web page together. 
					It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like Flexbox is applied to its parent element).
					 <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div">More about div element.</a>
					 
					</p>
					
				</li>
				
				<li> 
					<p>
						The <u> span </u> HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. <u> span </u> is very much like a <u> div </u> element, but <u> div </u> is a block-level element whereas a <u> span </u> is an inline-level element.
