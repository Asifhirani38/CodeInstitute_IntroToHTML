<!-- 
!DOCTYPE has to be the first thing in the HTML document. 
It is NOT an HTML tag. It tells the browser about the version of HTML this document uses.

				  <p> 
					
					Programming paradigm is an approach to solve problem using some programming language or also we can say it is a method to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach. There are lots for programming language that are known but all of them need to follow some strategy when they are implemented and this methodology/strategy is paradigms.

				<li style="color:darkblue"> 
					
					<p> Imperative programming is a software development paradigm where Functions are implicitly coded in every step required to solve a problem. In imperative programming, every operation is coded and the code itself specifies how the problem is to be solved, which means that pre-coded models are not called on.
					</p> 
				</li>
				
				<li style="color:darkblue">
					<p> Declarative programming describes what you want the program to achieve rather than how it should run.
						In other words, within the declarative paradigm, you define the results you want a program to accomplish without describin its control flow. Ultimately, it’s up to the programming language’s implementation and the compiler to determine how to achieve the results. This places emphasis not on the execution process, but on the results and their ties to your overall goal.

				  <p> Declarative programming languages often work hand-in-hand with Imperative programming languages.
					In Full-Stack programming, we take advantage of what both paradigms have to offer.
					Throughout the programme, you will immerse yourself in both paradigms and utilize the strengths of each.
					You will begin with the HTML and CSS declarative languages
					then explore the JavaScript and Python Imperative languages before returning to the SQL Declarative language.
					As you progress, you will combine all of these languages and their supporting tools by taking advantage of their
					individual strengths in producing compelling web-based experiences. </p>

				<li style="color:darkblue">
					  <p> 
					  
						The first thing in every HTML document should be the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration because it tells the browser the version of HTML 
						to expect in the current document. In this case, HTML version 5 (abbreviated to HTML5) is used. 
						It is not an HTML tag, but it is placed above the opening HTML tag as the first thing included in the HTML file. 
						A page can have only one DOCTYPE declaration. When you view the page in a browser, the declaration is not visible. 
					  
					  </p>
				</li>
				
				<li style="color:darkblue">
					<p>The <u> html</u> element tells the browser that the current document is a HTML document. This element contains the entire web page. 
					   It’s a container for all the other elements and is defined by its opening 'html' and closing '/html' tags. 
					   The html element is also known as the root element. This element has two directly contained (child) elements namely; <u> head </u> and <u> body </u>. </p>
				
				</li>
				
				<li style="color:darkblue"> 
					<p> 
					
						When writing HTML code, it is always a good idea to create your closing tag immediately after creating your opening tag. 
						That way, you won’t forget to do it later. Many code editors will add it automatically for you. 
					</p>
					
				</li>

				<li style="color:darkblue">
					<p> The famous hyperlink element, <em> <u> also known as the anchor </u> </em>, has an attribute that
						contains the address of the HTML resource that it links to. In HTML content links that are supposed to be interacted with you is the anchor element.
						The anchor element defines an anchor or a specific part of a page that
						can be linked to and a link article somewhere so it needs an address.So to use the anchor element as a link to another page we use the href attribute.
						Which will hold the address of where it needs to go to, the href attribute
						has as its value the location of the page or resource we'd like to link to.
					</p>
					
				</li>
				
				<li style="color:darkblue">
					<p> 
					
						The <u> head </u> element contains metadata about the page and links to external resources such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript files. 
						This element is the first child of <u> html </u> element. It holds all the information about the page that is not displayed in the browser.

						Metadata – is data that describes other data. For example, it can specify who wrote the document and provide a list of keywords and phrases used in the document. 
						We will discuss metadata in more detail in a later section of this module.
					
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li style="color:darkblue"> 
					<p> 
						
						The <u> title </u> element is contained (nested) inside the <u> head </u> element. It displays the document title. 
						This title will appear in the browser tab rather than on the main browser window. Nothing listed within the <u> head </u> element directly appears 
						on the main browser screen.
					
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li style="color:darkblue">
					  <p> 
							The <u>body</u> element uses any local or external CSS and JavaScript included in the <head> element to apply logic and styling to itself and its contents.

						  Any visible web page content is created within the opening and closing <u>body</u> tags.

						  The <u>body</u> element is the only sibling of the <u> head </u> so it is also a first descendant of the <u> html </u> element. 
						  It's created immediately below the <u> head </u> element.

						  The <u>body</u> element contains the visible parts of the web document (page). 
						  Everything that a user sees on the page lives inside the <u>body</u>. Therefore, all of the page's content will be added within the <u>body</u> tags.

						  Content can include images, paragraphs, headings, links, forms, tables, lists. We'll get to play with all of these as we go through the course.

		<h3> <u> Div and Span elements in HTML: </u> </h3>
		<a href=#welcome>Go to Welcome</a> <br>

		<a href=#fourthclass>Go to Intro to HTML </a> <br>
			<ol> 
				<li style="color:darkblue"> 
					<p> 
					
					The <u> div </u> element is used as a container for other HTML elements. The <u> div </u> element is often used to group sections of a web page together. 
					It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout 
					model like Flexbox is applied to its parent element).
					 <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div" target="_blank">More about div element.</a>
					 
					</p>
					
				</li>
				
				<li style="color:darkblue"> 
					<p>
						The <u> span </u> HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. 
						It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or 
						because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. <u> span </u> is 
						very much like a <u> div </u> element, but <u> div </u> is a block-level element whereas a <u> span </u> is an inline-level element.
						<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span" target="_blank">More about span element. </a>

		<h3> <u> Element attributes in HTML: </u> </h3>
			<ol> 
				<li style="color:darkblue"> 
					<p> 
					
					HTML attributes are pieces of code
					that give an HTML element extra customizable properties beyond the
					standard ones that come with the element type itself.
					Attributes apply a vast range of different properties and behaviors to their elements depending on
					which ones are used and which values they're given. 
					
					</p>
					
				</li>
				
				<li style="color:darkblue"> 
					<p>
						The syntax of a HTML attribute looks like this. An attribute is made up
						of two parts: the name of the attribute is on the left, and the value of the
						attribute is on the right. Quotation marks surround the value of
						the attribute and an equal sign goes between the name of the attribute and its value.
						We define attributes for a HTML element inside its opening HTML tag.
						They go after the name of the element and before the greater than sign that
						closes the opening tag. A single HTML element can hold multiple attributes
						when you are defining more than one attribute each attribute name and value
						pair is separated with a space.
						
					</p>
				</li>
				
			</ol>
			
		<h3> <u> Class in HTML: </u> </h3>
			<ol> 
				<li style="color:darkblue"> 
					<p> 
					
					The class attribute is a space-separated list of the classes assigned to an element. Classes allow CSS and JavaScript to select and access specific elements. 
					It enables elements to be semantically grouped together, and similar styles or actions can then be applied to them.
					Multiple elements with the same class value can be treated as a group for collective styling.
					
					</p>
					
				</li>
				
				<li style="color:darkblue">
					<p>
					
					To create a class; write a period (.) character, followed by a class name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}:
					
					</p>
					
				</li>
				
				<li style="color:darkblue"> 
					<p>
						The class name is case sensitive!
					</p>
					
				</li>
				
			</ol>
		
		<h3> <u> ID in HTML: </u> </h3>
			<ol> 
				<li style="color:darkblue"> 
					<p> 
					
					The HTML id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element.

					You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.
					
					</p>
					
				</li>
				
				<li style="color:darkblue">
					<p>
					
					While you are unlikely to see any errors from your HTML code if you accidentally use the same id twice, it will cause issues when other languages try to use the id value. When these languages target an element by its id , they will only access the first one they find in the HTML.
					
					</p>
					
				</li>
				
				<li style="color:darkblue"> 
					<p>
						Another thing to remember is that unlike the class attribute, we can't add multiple id values to the same element. An element can have one id, and that id must be unique.
					</p>
					
				</li>
				
			</ol>
			
		<h3><u>The Anchor tag in HTML:</u></h3>
		
			<ol>
				<li style="color:darkblue">
					<p>
					
					One of the core elements of the world wide web is the anchor,
					also known as a hyperlink. An anchor links from one page to another
					or from one section of a page to another. Remember that HTML stands for hypertext
					markup language. Hypertext implies that it contains hyperlinks.
					Hyper means that order is not linear the order of the linking
					does not matter and it is not important which document is visited first.
					The anchor element can be used to link
					to other web documents files or locations within the same page.
					
					</p>
					
				</li>
				
				<li style="color:darkblue">
					<p>
					By default, an anchor element will turn any text inside it blue
					and an underline will appear when the element is hovered over with a mouse.
					An anchor element must have a href attribute.
					Href is short for hypertext reference and the value you give it is the
					location the user will be taken to when they click on the link.
					If the link you are providing in the href attribute is to a separate site,
					it is best practice to include the target attribute (targert="_blank") on your anchor element.
					When you use the target attribute with its value set to underscore blank
					it changes the behavior of the link so that it opens in the new tab.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li style="color:darkblue">
					<p>
					The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document.

					Only used if the href attribute is present.

		<h3> <u> Internal links in HTML: </u> </h3>

					Internal links provide a link to an element within the same page. When clicked, an internal link moves the view of the page so that the relevant section is at the top of the browser window
					</p>
					
				</li>
				
				<li style="color:darkblue"> <p> Internal link syntax looks like this:

		<h3><u>Lists in HTML:</u></h3>
		
			<ol type="I">
				<li style="color:darkblue">
					<p>
						An ordered list is declared using the element <u>ol</u>, then each item in the list is defined using the  element, <u>li</u> nested inside the element.
						By default, each list item will be numbered according to their appearance in the list. But you can override that by specifying character and roman numeral sequences using its type attribute. You can learn more about the different values you can apply to your ordered list in this documentation .
					</p>
				</li>
				<li style="color:darkblue">
					<p>
						An ordered list is used when the sequence of the list items is essential. It might reflect a sequence of steps to be carried out, or it might indicate some ranking of things.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		
		<h3> <u> Unordered list in HTML </u> </h3>
		
			<ol> 
				<li style="color:darkblue">
					<p>
					You declare an unordered list using the <u> ul </u> element. Then just like with an ordered list, each item in the list is defined using the <u>li</u> element, nested inside the <u> ul</u> element.
					By default, each list item will be displayed on a new line, with a bullet-point marker next to it. By default, the bullet point will be a solid circle. If the unordered list is nested inside another list, the bullet-point marker will change by default to reflect this.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li style="color:darkblue">
					<p>
						The type of bullet-point used can also be changed with CSS using the list-style-type property.
						An unordered list is used when the sequence of the list items is not important.
					</p>
				</li>
		
			</ol>

		<h3> <u> Tables in HTML </u> </h3>
			<ol>
				<li style="color:darkblue">
					<p> 
						A HTML table is constructed using four different types of elements. The <u>table</u> element is the
						parent element for the entire table. All the other elements nest inside it.
						The <u>tr</u> element defines each row of the table tr stands for table row and each row is
						nested directly inside the table element. The <u>th</u> element is used to define the
						headings for the table, typically nested in the top table row element,
						the th stands for table header. The <u>td</u> element represents your table
						cells that contain the data to be displayed td stands for table data and
						this element is also nested inside table row elements.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
 
 
		<h3> <u> Forms in HTML </u> </h3>
			<ol>
				<li style="color:darkblue">
					<p> 
						Forms collect input from the user. They are essential for the interaction between a user and a website or application. They contain input elements where a user can enter information, such as an email address or a password. You see and use forms all the time onl		
						A <u> form </u> element contains other elements that make up the structure of the form. Those elements can be text fields (single line or multiline), select boxes, buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons and many other elements used to collect data.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h4 style="color:olive"> <u> Input element in HTML Forms: </u> </h4>
				
				<ul>
					
					<li style="color:darkblue">
						
						<p>
						
						The <u> input </u> element is One of the most used form elements is the <u> input </u> element.
						The <u> input </u> element can be displayed in several ways, depending on the type attribute. Some examples of input element are:
						<code> input type="text</code> or <code>input name="password" </code> or <code> input type="submit"</code> or <code> input placeholder="Your feedback" <code>
						
						</p>
					
					</li>
					
					<li style="color:darkblue">
						
						<h4> <u>The Name Attribute for <u> input: </u> </u></h4> <p>Notice that each input field must have a name attribute to be submitted.If the name attribute is omitted, the value of the input field will not be sent at all.
						The name attribute is essential for processing the data the user has sent. It provides a key with which to pair the data in the database. For example, if a user inputs the data "William Preston" into an input field with name="full_name" on it, the data would be stored in the database as { "full_name" : "William Preston" }.
						</p>
					</li>
					
					<li style="color:darkblue">
						<p>
							An <u> input </u> field can also have a value attribute. This attribute specifies the initial value of the input field. This value will not disappear when a user starts typing, but they can delete and replace it if they want to. The value attribute is useful to pre-populate a form with existing data. When a value attribute is used on an input field with type="submit" the value given to the value attribute replaces the default "Submit" text on the button.
						</p>
					</li>
					
					<li style="color:darkblue">
						<p>
							An <u> input </u> field can also have a placeholder attribute. The value set to the placeholder displays hint text before a user starts entering data into the field. When a user starts typing, the placeholder text will disappear.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li style="color:darkblue">
						<p> 
						
							As the form element is for collecting data from the user, the form needs some important attributes to tell it where and how to send the data. To do this, we use the attributes action and method on the form element.The value of the action attribute is the URL location of the data processing program to which the data will be sent.The method attribute tells the browser which HTTP method should be used when transmitting data. Only GET and POST methods can be a value of the method attribute.
							
						</p>
						
					</li>
					
					<li style="color:darkblue">
						<p>
						
							As with all html attributes, the order that they are written in is not important. Most developers have a preference for the ordering they use, but there is no hard and fast rule for this. Therefore you will see occasions when a method attribute is defined before the action attribute on a form element, and vice versa.
							
						</p>
						
					</li>
					
				</ul>
				
			<h4 style="color:olive"> <u> Textarea element in HTML Forms: </u> </h4>
				<ul>
					<li style="color:darkblue">
						<p>
							<ul type="circle">
							<li style="color:darkblue"> <b> A <u> textarea </u> is useful when you need to give the user an area to enter a more substantial amount of text than a simple <code> input type="text" </code> field provides.

							</li>
							<li style="color:darkblue"> <b> Unlike the <u> input </u> element, the <u> textarea </u> element does have a closing tag.

							<li style="color:darkblue"> <b> Like the previous input types we have discussed, the <u> textarea </u>  also needs values for name and id attributes, and its <u> label </u> element should have a matching for attribute for its id.</li> </b>

			<h3>The <u>img</u> element in HTML</h3>
				<ol> 
					<li>
			
						<p>The <u>img</u> element is a self-closing element, meaning it cannot have other content nested inside it, and it has no closing tag.The <u>img</u> element takes two important attributes: The src attribute, which takes the file path to the image file to be displayed. And the alt attribute for text to be displayed if the image file does not load, and to describe the image on screen readers for visually impaired users.
						 The <u>img</u> element can also take height and width attributes to control its size. Though it is worth bearing in mind, it is better practice to use CSS to control height and width properties, once you have learned how, of course.

			<h3>The HTML <u>picture</u> Tag</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						The picture tag gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources.

							The most common use of the picture element will be for art direction in responsive designs. Instead of having one image that is scaled up or down based on the viewport width, multiple images can be designed to more nicely fill the browser viewport.
							
							The picture element contains two tags: one or more source tags and one img tag.
							
							The browser will look for the first source element where the media query matches the current viewport width, and then it will display the proper image (specified in the srcset attribute). The img element is required as the last child of the picture element, as a fallback option if none of the source tags matches.
							
							Tip: The picture element works "similar" to video and audio. You set up different sources, and the first source that fits the preferences is the one being used.
					</li>
				</ol>
			<h3> The Audio Element</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							The audio element is used to embed sound content into a web page. The source of the audio file is defined using the src attribute on the audio element.The audio element can take several other attributes depending on the behaviour you want it to have. If the controls attribute is included the browser will give the user controls for audio playback, including volume and pause. The loop attribute will set the audio file to start over each time it is finished. And the muted attribute specifies if the audio file should be muted when the file is first loaded.The autoplay attribute, when set, will automatically play the audio on page load. However, it is considered a bad user experience to autoplay audio or video that has sound on it. Some browsers - including Chrome - will block audio files from playing automatically until the user interacts with the page.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Browsers don't all support the same file types for audio, so if you want to be sure your audio file will play on all of them you can provide multiple sources inside nested <source> elements, and the browser will use the first one that it finds compatible.When nested inside an <audio> element, the <source> element takes two attributes: The src attribute, which defines the path to the audio file, and type, which defines the type of audio file. The value for the type attribute here is either audio/mpeg or audio/ogg.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							An audio element can also contain a track element. This element is used to reference timed text tracks (or time-based data), for example, to handle displaying subtitles automatically.You can read more about the track element in this documentation.As the audio element was introduced with HTML5, some browsers do not support it. So like the iframe element, you can leave a message between the audio opening and closing tags to be displayed to users of these browsers. You can put any html elements between your audio element tags; common choices are paragraph, anchor or heading elements for a text-based message. However, you could add an image, button or any other relevant content that makes sense to display to a user who can't access the audio element with their browser.

			<h3> The Video Element</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							format of the video element is <code>video src="myVideo.mp4" width="500" autoplay muted loop</code>.
							The video element is used to embed video content into a web page. The source of the video file is defined using the src attribute on the video element.Like the audio element, the video element can take several other attributes, depending on the behaviour you want it to have:If the controls attribute is included, the browser will give the user controls to the user for video playback, including volume and pause.The loop attribute will set the video file to start over each time it is finished.The muted attribute specifies if the video file should be muted when the file is first loaded.When the autoplay attribute is set, the video will automatically play the on loading the page.It is considered a bad user experience to autoplay a video that has sound on it. So if you use the autoplay property, it is also recommended to use the muted attribute, so the video is silent.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Browsers don't all support the same file types for video, so if you want to be sure your video file will play on all of them you can provide multiple sources inside nested source elements, and the browser will use the first one that it finds compatible.
							When nested inside a video element, the source element takes two attributes: The src attribute, which defines the path to the video file. And the type attribute, which defines the type of video file. The value for the type attribute here is either video/webm, video/mp4 or video/ogg. You can read more about multiple video sources in this documentation.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							As the video element was introduced with HTML5, some browsers do not support it. So like the audio and iframe elements, you can leave a message between the video opening and closing tags to be displayed to users of these browsers.The video element can also take the width and/or height attribute to control its size.
